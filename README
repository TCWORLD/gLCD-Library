gLCD Library

A library for Arduino which allows the communication of the Arduino with a Nokia 128px x 128px display such as those sold by SparkFun Electronics.
The library allows communication with both the Phillips and EPSON controllers, so should work with almost all of these screens.

Please see the example sketches and also the gLCD.h header file for extensive information as to what functions are in the library and how they work.
